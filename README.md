# microgpt-ts

A TypeScript port of Andrej Karpathy's [microgpt](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/8627fe009c40f57531cb18360106ce95) — a complete GPT built from scratch with **zero runtime dependencies**. Supports training and inference.

No PyTorch. No TensorFlow. Just TypeScript, ~400 lines of code. Runs in the browser.

**Try the live playground: [microgpt-ts.vercel.app](https://microgpt-ts.vercel.app/)**

## What is this?

A character-level GPT that learns to generate text. Everything is built from scratch: a `Value` class that tracks computations and backpropagates gradients through the chain rule, a GPT architecture (embeddings, multi-head attention, MLP, residual connections, RMSNorm), and an Adam optimizer. Train it on ~32k names and watch it generate new ones.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### CLI demo

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm demo
```

Trains on ~32k names for 1000 steps, then generates new ones:

```
num docs: 32033
vocab size: 27
chars: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
num params: 4192
step    1 / 1000 | loss 3.3075
step    2 / 1000 | loss 2.9965
step    3 / 1000 | loss 3.2289
...
step  801 / 1000 | loss 1.9760
training time: 11.06s

--- inference (new, hallucinated names) ---
sample  1: kadan
sample  2: alele
sample  3: rian
sample  4: kanani
sample  5: dahe
```

### Web playground

An interactive browser playground that trains and runs the GPT entirely client-side — no server needed.

```bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Head to `localhost:3000/playground` to train a model and generate text in real time, or use the hosted version at [microgpt-ts.vercel.app](https://microgpt-ts.vercel.app/playground).

Features:

- **Preset datasets** — baby names, Pokemon, cocktails, movie titles, fortunes, and more
- **Custom data** — paste or upload your own text
- **Configurable architecture** — adjust embedding size, attention heads, layers, and block size
- **Live training** — real-time loss charts and sample generation as the model trains
- **Token-level inference** — step through generation one token at a time with probability distributions
- **Temperature control** — adjust sampling randomness during generation
- **Prefix conditioning** — seed generation with a starting string

## Progression

The [blog post](https://karpathy.github.io/2026/02/12/microgpt/) describes building the model up in layers, one component at a time. This repo follows the same progression — each step is a separate PR:

| Step | What it adds | PR |
|------|--------------|----|
| train0 | Bigram count table — no neural net, no gradients | [#1](https://github.com/dubzdubz/microgpt-ts/pull/1) |
| train1 | MLP + manual gradients (numerical & analytic) + SGD | [#2](https://github.com/dubzdubz/microgpt-ts/pull/2) |
| train2 | Autograd (`Value` class) — replaces manual gradients | [#3](https://github.com/dubzdubz/microgpt-ts/pull/3) |
| train3 | Position embeddings + single-head attention + RMSNorm + residuals | [#4](https://github.com/dubzdubz/microgpt-ts/pull/4) |
| train4 | Multi-head attention + layer loop — full GPT architecture | [#5](https://github.com/dubzdubz/microgpt-ts/pull/5) |
| train5 | Adam optimizer | [#6](https://github.com/dubzdubz/microgpt-ts/pull/6) |

## Development

Scripts from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm demo          # Run CLI demo (train + generate)
pnpm dev           # Start web dev server (localhost:3000)
pnpm build:web     # Production build
pnpm storybook     # Component stories (localhost:6006)
pnpm lint          # Check with Biome
pnpm lint:fix      # Auto-fix with Biome
```

The web app uses Next.js 16, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS v4, and Biome for linting/formatting. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for coding conventions.
